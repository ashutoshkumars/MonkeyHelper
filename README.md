MonkeyHelper
============

MonkeyHelper offers recording, replaying and manipulation  capabilities for Android usage traces. It also provides wrappers for common Android Development Tools (adb, aapt, etc). All in Python. 

# Use cases
We highlight some use cases that could be useful for different purposes.
* Record a trace from an Android box and replay it. This could be useful for debugging and testing apps. The trace can be stored as a simple text file, essentially everywhere.
* Record, manipulate and then replay a trace. The manipulation functionality allows one to change a small fraction of the trace (e.g. add a swipe, etc).
* Fusion multiple traces. Pick a gesture from one trace and paste it to another.
